## <center>E926 Api Module</center>

(side note: this is an SFW ONLY version of [E6API](https://npmjs.org/package/E6API), the filtering is done by sending requests to e926.net instead of e621.net, you should do filtering on your side as well if you want only sfw posts, as there is no extra filtering being done!)

### This module returns only sfw posts! For no filter, see [E6API](https://npmjs.org/package/e6api), that module will not filter any posts based on ratings!

Please see [E6API](https://npmjs.org/package/e6api) for the documentation, as this is just a reskinned version of that module.
